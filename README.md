# Godot 4 CameraFeed tutorial

example project from my [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oVyGHeYWYU0) on using CameraFeed with Godot 4.

there are some minor changes:

- `CamSprite.camera_name` changed to an export var, so you can edit it the inspector
- if `camera_name` is left empty, uses the first available camera
